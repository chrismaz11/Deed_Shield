# Legacy Archive 2026-02-25

This archive contains superseded planning and reference documentation consolidated into `docs/final/*`.

## Archived sections
- `source-of-truth/`: synthesized planning and assumption drafts
- `lab-notebook/`: dated R&D working logs
- `notebook/`: experimental v2 notebook
- `compliance/`: superseded compliance drafts merged into final baseline docs + legal policy set
- `developer/`: superseded `demo.md` and `curl.md`
- `customer/`: superseded pilot/user guides
- `ops/`: superseded operations runbooks

## Why archived
These files were valuable during exploration and early pilot setup, but they created overlap, drift, and conflicting guidance. They are retained for history, not for current implementation decisions.
