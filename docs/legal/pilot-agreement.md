# Pilot Program Terms

**Version:** 2.0
**Effective Date:** 2026-02-25

## 1. Pilot Scope
These terms govern participation in the TrustSignal / Deed Shield pilot program. The pilot is intended to validate integrations, verification workflows, and operational readiness.

## 2. Pilot Nature
Participants acknowledge that pilot services are pre-production and may include incomplete features, control changes, or service interruptions while the platform matures.

## 3. License
TrustSignal grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and evaluate pilot functionality for internal business use.

## 4. Participant Obligations
Participants must:
- use pilot access only for authorized internal testing
- follow data-handling requirements and documentation boundaries
- avoid submitting prohibited data unless explicitly approved in writing
- report material defects or security concerns promptly through designated channels

## 5. Restrictions
Participants must not:
- misuse pilot outputs as legal conclusions or guarantees
- attempt unauthorized access, reverse engineering, or abuse of platform controls
- represent pilot behavior as final GA behavior without written authorization

## 6. Feedback
Feedback and suggestions provided during the pilot may be used by TrustSignal to improve the Service without additional compensation unless separately agreed in writing.

## 7. Term and Termination
Pilot access remains active until pilot completion or termination by either party. TrustSignal may suspend or terminate pilot access for security, misuse, or operational reasons.

## 8. Liability and Indemnity
Unless otherwise specified in a signed agreement, pilot services are provided as-is and without pilot-specific indemnity commitments.

## 9. Relationship to Master Terms
These pilot terms supplement the Terms of Service and applicable signed commercial agreements. Where a signed agreement conflicts, the signed agreement controls.
