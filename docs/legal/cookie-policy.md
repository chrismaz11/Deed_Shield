## 1. Purpose
This policy explains how TrustSignal and Deed Shield use cookies and similar technologies in web-facing service components.

Our default model is first-party operational tracking for service delivery and reliability.

We do not use third-party advertising trackers for cross-site behavioral advertising within the pilot and core product experience.

## 3. Cookie Categories
### 3.1 Strictly Necessary Cookies
Required for secure session and platform operation, including:
- session continuity
- CSRF and related security protections
- platform routing and load-balancing continuity

### 3.2 Operational and Performance Signals
Used for reliability and support operations, including:
- request volume and latency trends
- error-rate and health monitoring
- service diagnostics used for incident response

## 4. User Controls
Browser settings may allow cookie restrictions. Restricting necessary cookies may prevent authentication and core verification flows from functioning.

## 5. Policy Updates
We may revise this policy as service functionality evolves. The version and effective date at the top indicate the current policy.
