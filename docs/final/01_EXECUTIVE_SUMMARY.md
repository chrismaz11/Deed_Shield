# TrustSignal / Deed Shield Executive Summary

## Product Position
TrustSignal is a verification platform with Deed Shield as the property-records module. The immediate business objective is production-ready operation for title and lender pilots, followed by ICE Mortgage Technology / Encompass marketplace integration.

## Current Priority
The priority is operational and security readiness over feature expansion:
- close production blockers with staging evidence
- stabilize integration-critical APIs and controls
- produce marketplace-grade documentation and support artifacts

## Boundaries
- TrustSignal provides technical verification signals, not legal opinions.
- Pilot and early production workflows must avoid unnecessary PII exposure.
- On-chain anchoring is limited to non-PII cryptographic artifacts.

## Delivery Model
Execution is governed by `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `PRODUCTION_GOVERNANCE_TRACKER.md` with explicit phase gates:
1. Pilot-ready for title companies and lenders
2. ICE/Encompass marketplace-ready
3. Long-term hardening and refactors
